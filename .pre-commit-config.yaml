# pre-commit is a useful tool which can be setup  by contributors
# per-repository in a few simple steps given that the
# repository has a config file like this one.
#
# The configured hooks are run on `git commit`. If one of the hooks makes or
# demands a change of the commits contents the commit process is aborted.
# The hooks can also be run manually through `pre-commit run --all-files`.
